<h1><center>Kristina Randrup | Cartographer & GIS Analyst & Much More</center></h1>

<p>To start with the basics, I have a BS in Environmental Science and Resource Management, with a concentration in Wildlife 
Management, which I earned at the University of Washington. At the same time, I earned minors in both Math and Quantitative
Science. I am on my way towards a Masters in GIS with the University of Wisconsin, which I will complete in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Between undergraduate and graduate programs, I worked as a GIS Intern with The Nature Conservancy for almost a year, primarily
studying Natural Climate Solutions.</p>

<p> Outside of work and school, I run, run, and run. When I'm not working hard at a computer, I'm working hard on a trail running 
up a mountain or racing farther than a marathon. Someday I'll hopefully be running on a world team competing on a big stage
with many top-notch athletes. If you're interested, check out my <a href="athlete_resume.pdf" target="_blank"> athlete resume</a>!</p>
